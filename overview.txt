I specialize in getting your web and mobile apps into users hands quickly. I take pride in my work and do it the right way. I've worked for consultancies which have dumped me on projects that are hell to work on because "we needed to move fast in the beginning". That's not the kind of work I do. You will never hear anyone say that about my work. I do fast, quality work and the pace of development does not stop after a year or two or three. The experience I hold most dear I learned while working at Pivotal Labs. Go check out their recent clients and billing habits.
